		<h2>"... a lush crosscurrent of peculiarly fine poetry." <i>-Geoffrey Gatza, Publisher, BlazeVox Books</i>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
		<h2> In The Metaphysician’s Daughter, Richard K. Ostrander’s poems 
		combine a recollection of an uncomfortable past with a large dose of Americana, 
		strip malls and dry wit. His speakers yearn for freedom as they navigate 
		their wounds and losses, synthesizing Southern culture with TV and technology
		<br>
		(“They say radio waves never die, just ripple / 
		Out into space, their signal growing inaudible / 
		As this flight of leaves in currents of air”) 
		<br>
		that tantalizes, yet also isolates. After reading this collection, you’ll 
		hear and nod to the music of the ordinary and transcendental.
		<br>
		<br>
